This is my to-do list project for the Javascript course of The Odin Project! I'm very excited for this one, and plan on expanding this beyond the curriculum requirements in the future to truly make it my own. This will come in handy in my personal daily life.

Notes:

there will be a default projects folder, as well as more specific folder. For ex: a. Gym/Health b. Education c. Projects d. Home e. Work-related f. Personal .....figure out how to add an option to create custom folders.....
- add login feature to safely store data across devices
- add feature to filter projects based on type (gym, personal, social, chores, etc)
-- Add a function that provides example place-holder to-dos (ex: take out trash, fold laundry, baptise the cats...)
--Add calendar/calendar view of upcoming events
--Add function to show the # of tasks per subfolder
--Add ctrl F function to search through all tasks
--Add archive for completed projects (show task date)
